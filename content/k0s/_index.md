[k0s](https://k0sproject.io/) is a Kubernetes distribution developed by [Mirantis](https://mirantis.com). It is shipped as a single binary without any OS dependencies and is thus defined as a zero-friction/zero-deps/zero-cost Kubernetes distribution.

k0s delivers a fully functional Kubernetes experience with:

- **Certified Kubernetes**: Ships CIS-benchmarked Kubernetes
- **Cross-platform support**: Runs on x86-64, ARM64 and ARMv7 architectures
- **Complete runtime stack**: Uses containerd, in-cluster etcd, and Kube-router networking
- **Built-in observability**: Includes CoreDNS, Metrics Server, and HPA support
- **Production ready**: Minimal footprint with enterprise-grade features

This makes k0s ideal for edge computing, IoT deployments, and any scenario where you need Kubernetes without complexity.
